# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

This project was built to make changes to HTML for Search Engine Optimization, as well as organization and documentation of the website's CSS. The HTML has been changed to include semantic HTML rather than the unnecessary selectors. The CSS has been changed to remove redundancy as well as addidng commentation.

## Usage

Right clicking on the webpage and selecting "Inspect" will open up Chrome's Developer Tools. There you can see the added semantic HTML and the grouped CSS selectors.
